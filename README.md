# Automated Testing of Web Mapping Applications
This repository includes resources for the "Automated Testing of Web Mapping Applications" talk from DevSummit 2017.

## Abstract
There are many types of automated testing for web applications, from isolated unit tests of a single JavaScript function to end-to-end tests that exercise your entire stack in multiple browsers. We'll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the main types of tests and share how we decide what kinds of tests to write. We'll give an overview of the different tools that are available for each type of test, and demonstrate the tools we use to write and automatically execute tests as part of our process for continuously delivering quality software.
